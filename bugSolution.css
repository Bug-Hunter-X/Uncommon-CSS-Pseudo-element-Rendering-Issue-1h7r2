The solution involves adjusting the CSS selector specificity or the order of the rules within the stylesheet to ensure the intended style is applied to the pseudo-element.  This might involve using more specific selectors, adding !important (though generally discouraged), or reorganizing the CSS rules to ensure the desired style is applied last.  In the solution, we've adjusted the selectors to have higher specificity than any conflicting selectors.
