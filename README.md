This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS bug involving pseudo-elements (:before or :after). The issue arises from unexpected selector specificity or rule order, resulting in the pseudo-element not rendering or behaving as intended.  The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version. The problem highlights the importance of understanding CSS specificity and the cascading order of stylesheets.
